# Chick-Fil-A--Ordering

Harry Wang - 1A ECE at University of Waterloo

Have you ever wanted to order Chik-Fil-A but wasn't able to decide waht you wanted to eat or how much it would cost?

Well, in the case of me and my friend Brennon, we decided to create a software that gives information abotu yoru order and allows users
to test order combinations so that they can find the right one for them and for the right price.

In this software, we used a variety of python techniques such as classes, arrays, conditional loops, etc. in order for users to input the
orders that they want and test out the different varietys/combinations of orders that they can get from Chick-Fil-A.
